## Publishing to S3

To publish to the default bucket and repository that's defined in the Makefile:

$ make s3cfg=PATH_TO_S3CFG publish

PATH_TO_S3CFG should be the location of the s3cfg file containing your s3
credentials. Use s3cfg.in provided with this project as the template for this
file.

To publish to a different bucket and repository:

$ make s3cfg=PATH_TO_S3CFG publish_bucket=BUCKET publish_repo=REPO publish

BUCKET is the s3 bucket. REPO is the repository within the bucket (repository
is just a directory name).
